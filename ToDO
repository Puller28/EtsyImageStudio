Based on my deep understanding of your Etsy Image Studio system, here are strategic feature recommendations organized by priority and impact:

High-Impact Quick Wins 🎯

1. Bulk Project Operations
Why: You have users with 13+ projects - managing them individually is tedious

Bulk delete/archive projects
Batch download all assets from multiple projects
Multi-select mockups for download
Impact: Saves 5-10 minutes per session for power users

2. Project Templates/Presets
Why: Users repeat the same workflows

Save workflow configurations (upscale 2x + 5 specific mockups + 3 print formats)
One-click "Repeat Last Workflow"
"Etsy Starter Pack" preset (most popular settings)
Impact: Reduces setup time from 2-3 minutes to 10 seconds

3. Smart Mockup Recommendations
Why: You have data on which templates work best

"Top 5 mockups for wall art" based on analytics
Room-specific suggestions based on artwork style
