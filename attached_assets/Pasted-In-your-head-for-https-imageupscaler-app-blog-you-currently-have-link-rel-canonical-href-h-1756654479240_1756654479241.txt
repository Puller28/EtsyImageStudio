In your <head> for https://imageupscaler.app/blog you currently have:

<link rel="canonical" href="https://imageupscaler.app/blog" id="canonical-url">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://imageupscaler.app/blog" id="og-url">
<meta property="og:type" content="website" id="og-type">


This is fine for the blog index page itself, but the problem is that the same snippet appears to be used across all blog subpages (like /blog/ai-image-upscaling-print-on-demand).

So for articles, you are still serving a canonical pointing to /blog, which means:

Sitemap says: “Please index /blog/ai-image-upscaling-print-on-demand”

Canonical says: “No, use /blog instead.”

That mismatch is what Ahrefs is reporting as “Non-canonical page in sitemap”.

🔧 How to Fix

Blog index page
Keep as-is:

<link rel="canonical" href="https://imageupscaler.app/blog">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://imageupscaler.app/blog">
<meta property="og:type" content="website">


Blog article pages
Change to self-referencing canonicals:

<link rel="canonical" href="https://imageupscaler.app/blog/ai-image-upscaling-print-on-demand">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://imageupscaler.app/blog/ai-image-upscaling-print-on-demand">
<meta property="og:type" content="article">


Each article page must dynamically insert its own canonical/og:url instead of inheriting the /blog defaults.

🚨 Why It’s Important

Right now, all blog content points back to /blog, which means:

Google won’t index your articles separately.

All SEO value consolidates to /blog.

Your sitemap and canonical tags conflict, hence the warnings.

👉 Do you want me to produce a URL → Correct Canonical mapping for all the blog/article pages shown in your Ahrefs report, so your devs can implement them directly?

You said:
would this be the truth for all pages?
ChatGPT said:

Yes — this principle applies to all indexable pages on your site:

If the page is meant to rank and appear in Google, the <link rel="canonical"> should be a self-referencing canonical (the exact same URL as the page itself).

If the page is not meant to rank (like admin, login, checkout, test pages), then it should either:

Have a canonical pointing to another preferred URL, and

Be excluded from the sitemap.

✅ Rule of Thumb for Your Site

Homepage

Canonical: https://imageupscaler.app/

Blog index

Canonical: https://imageupscaler.app/blog

Each blog article

Canonical: https://imageupscaler.app/blog/<slug>

Static pages (about-us, contact, privacy-policy, features, etc.)

Canonical: their exact URL.
Example:

/about-us → https://imageupscaler.app/about-us

/contact → https://imageupscaler.app/contact

Pages you don’t want indexed (e.g. internal-only or duplicates)

Add <meta name="robots" content="noindex, follow">

Remove them from sitemap.

🚨 Why This Is Critical

Right now, as your Ahrefs crawl shows, all your pages are pointing their canonical to the homepage. That tells Google:

"Only index the homepage — ignore the blog posts, contact page, about page, etc."

That’s why Ahrefs is reporting “Non-canonical page in sitemap”.

👉 Do you want me to create a full canonical mapping table (URL → Correct Canonical) for all the pages Ahrefs flagged in your screenshots, so you can give it straight to your devs as a checklist?

Yes please

Brilliant — here’s a clean mapping you can hand straight to your devs.
Policy: no trailing slash everywhere, HTTPS, non-www
. Every page below is indexable and should be self-canonical.

If there are any other blog posts, follow the same pattern:
/blog/<slug> → canonical https://imageupscaler.app/blog/<slug> with og:type=article.

Implementation notes for Replit

Render server-side. Do not rely on JS to rewrite canonicals.

Remove any global HTTP Link: … rel="canonical" header or generate it per page to exactly match the HTML canonical.

Ensure sitemap <loc> values are identical to the canonicals above.

Enforce redirects so only the preferred form resolves with 200

http → https, www → non-www, with-slash → no-slash for non-root.
