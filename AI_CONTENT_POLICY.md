## Best Practices for Prompts

### Focus on Descriptions, Not Names

Instead of:

- "The Beatles"

Use:
- "Elegant gentleman in vintage suit"

- "1960s rock band performing on stage"

### Describe the Scene

Good prompts focus on:
- **Action**: "jumping", "fighting", "dancing", "flying"
- **Style**: "watercolor", "oil painting", "digital art", "photorealistic"
- **Mood**: "dramatic", "peaceful", "energetic", "mysterious"
- **Composition**: "close-up", "wide angle", "portrait", "landscape"
- **Lighting**: "golden hour", "dramatic shadows", "soft lighting", "neon lights"

### Example Prompts That Work Well

1. **Action Scenes**
   - "Martial artist performing aerial kick, motion blur, professional sports photography"
   - "Athlete in mid-jump, dynamic pose, stadium background, dramatic lighting"

2. **Portraits**
   - "Elegant woman in vintage dress, soft lighting, classic portrait style"
   - "Wise elderly person with kind eyes, detailed facial features, warm tones"

3. **Landscapes**
   - "Mountain landscape at sunset, dramatic clouds, vibrant colors, professional photography"
   - "Peaceful forest scene, morning mist, soft light filtering through trees"

4. **Abstract/Artistic**
   - "Abstract geometric shapes, vibrant colors, modern art style"
   - "Flowing watercolor patterns, soft pastels, dreamy atmosphere"

5. **Fantasy/Sci-Fi**
   - "Futuristic city skyline, neon lights, cyberpunk aesthetic, detailed architecture"
   - "Magical forest with glowing plants, fantasy atmosphere, enchanted scene"

## Error Messages Explained

### "No images were generated"

**Solution**: Rephrase using generic descriptions

### "CONTENT_SAFETY_BLOCK"
This means:

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Descriptive** - Use adjectives and details

3. **Focus on Style** - Mention art style, medium, or technique
4. **Set the Scene** - Describe environment, lighting, mood
5. **Use Examples** - "like a professional photograph" or "in the style of impressionism"

## Need Help?

If your prompt keeps getting blocked:

1. **Remove all names** - People, places, brands
2. **Simplify** - Start with basic description, add details gradually
3. **Use generic terms** - "warrior" instead of "samurai", "hero" instead of "superhero"
4. **Focus on composition** - What's in the scene, how it's arranged, what style

## Still Having Issues?

Try these safe, generic prompts to test:
- "Beautiful landscape with mountains and lake, sunset colors"
- "Abstract art with flowing colors, modern style"
- "Peaceful garden scene, soft lighting, detailed flowers"
